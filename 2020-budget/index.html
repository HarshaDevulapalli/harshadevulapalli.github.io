				<div class="budget-intro">
					<p>Crafting the budget is an annual reminder of a fundamental lesson of economics: we have scarce resources to pursue a multitude of goals.</p>
					<p>While governments have more leeway to borrow compared to private firms or individuals, they too are subject to the <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Money/Mo0rDd05TR45N3kl5oHWQN/Beware-the-ire-of-bond-vigilantes.html">constraints imposed by their creditors</a>. Just as people and companies make tough decisions every day, so must policymakers accept trade-offs: pursuing one goal often means giving up another. But for the government, the stakes are much higher because the trade-offs involve the lives of millions.</p>
					<p>In this budget game, you have a chance to play the finance minister. Youâ€™ll start by deciding what <span class="color-white background-blue background-pad font-family-sans">cuts</span> are needed. Remember, cutbacks may upset people.</p>
					<p>After making cuts, you can decide what to <span class="color-white background-green background-pad font-family-sans">spend</span> on and how much. Be careful: too much splurging will increase the <span class="color-white background-red background-pad font-family-sans">fiscal deficit</span>, raising borrowing costs, stoking inflation, and undermining the economy&rsquo;s stability.</p>

					<p>The choices available in the game are largely based on past recommendations made by policy-makers and economists, and on publicly available assessment reports of the government&rsquo;s schemes. The financial allocations for each scheme or project are based on last year&rsquo;s budget estimates for the current fiscal year.</p>
					<p>To be sure, the list of choices is not an exhaustive one. It does not include several items that are not part of the budgeting exercise but which can contribute to the exchequer and help meet the government&rsquo;s spending needs. For instance, the government could ask its top bureaucrats and ministers to give up on their palatial bungalows in Lutyens&rsquo; Delhi, and monetize the land to raise budgetary resources. There are at least 507 such (type 7 and type 8) bungalows in the Lutyens zone, with an estimated land area of 1.76 sq km. Applying the circle rate of Rs 7.74 lakh/metre, the estimated value of this land alone is Rs 1.36 trillion, enough to finance the fiscal deficit for a couple of years.</p>
					<p>The list of choices also does not include sales of state-owned firms from which the government could potentially raise much more money. The government is expected to target Rs 1 trillion in stake-sales over the next fiscal, but it could potentially raise much more by pursuing a more aggressive divestment agenda.</p>
					<p>None of these decisions are easy ones though. The decision to monetize Lutyens land will invite the wrath of the most powerful men and women in the country. An aggressive divestment agenda will upset trade unions and employees of state-owned firms, inviting protests from them.</p>
					<p>Still, when Arun Jaitley steps to the floor of parliament on February 1 to present the Union Budget for 2018-19, think of the choices you made in this game. They&rsquo;re exactly the sorts of tough choices the finance minister himself had to make.</p>

					Notes<br />
					1. The allocation for judiciary reflects allocation for judicial infrastructure as well as allocation for central schemes relating to legal reforms.<br />
					2. The allocation for modernization of police relates only to the funds alloted for modernization of police force, and not for other heads of expendture related to policing.<br />
					3. The budgetary allocation shown here for railways denotes the net budgetary support, and does not include other forms of financing for railways such as through the special fund for railway safety, Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh.<br />
					4. The budgeted fiscal deficit for the current fiscal was estimated to be 3.2 percent of GDP in the Budget last year based on the growth projection available at that time. But based on the latest estimates of GDP growth published by the CSO (which is lower than the earlier projection), the budgeted fiscal deficit turns out to be 3.3 percent.
